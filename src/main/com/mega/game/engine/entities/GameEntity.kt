/**
 * Default implementation of [IGameEntity] which takes a game engine, components map, and properties as parameters.
 * This implementation provides the open [spawn] and [destroy] methods which are shorthands for `engine.spawn(this)`
 * and `engine.destroy(this)` respectively. Having these methods also allows for custom logic to be implemented in the
 * spawn and destroy phases that would otherwise not be suitable for the [onSpawn] and [onDestroy] methods.
 *
 * The [initialized] and [spawned] are set and changed by the [GameEngine] class, and should be treated as read-only
 * variables in most cases.
 *
 * The `initialized` property determines if [init] should be called when the entity is spawned. The game engine will
 * call [init] and set `initialized` to true if `initialized` is false.
 *
 * The `spawned` property will be set to true when the entity is spawned by the game engine, and will be set to false
 * when the entity is destroyed by the game engine.
 *
 * @see [IGameEntity]
 * @see [GameEngine]
