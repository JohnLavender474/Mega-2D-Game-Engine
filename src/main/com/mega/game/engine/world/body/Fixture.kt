/**
 * An implementation for [IFixture]. This implementation stores a shape variable labeled [rawShape] and
 * calculates the body-relative shape in [getShape].
 *
 * @param body The body this fixture belongs to. This is used when calculating the body-relative shape in [getShape].
 * @param rawShape The raw bounds of this fixture. Defaults to a [GameRectangle] with size of zero. To get the bounds
 * of this fixture relative to the body it is attached to, use [getShape].
 * @param fixtureType The type for this fixture. Used to determine how this fixture interacts with other
 *   fixtures. It can be anything (String, Int, Enum, etc.) so long as it properly implements
 *   [Any.equals] and [Any.hashCode] such that any two fixtures with the same type are considered
 *   equal (only in terms of contact interaction, not in terms of object equality) and any two
 *   fixtures with different types are considered not equal (again, only in terms of contact
 *   interaction).
 * @param active Whether this fixture is active. If not active, this fixture will not be used to
 *   detect collisions.
 * @param attachedToBody Whether this fixture is attached to a body. If not attached to a body, this
 *   fixture will not move with the body it is attached to.
 * @param offsetFromBodyCenter The offset of this fixture from the center of the body it is attached
 *   to. Used to position this fixture relative to the body it is attached to. This is the offset
 *   before the body is rotated.
 * @param properties The properties of this fixture.
